                <p>I'm a dynamic and versatile professional with a robust blend of project management, 
                    business management, and data analysis expertise. Having worked across diverse industries, 
                    I am adept at navigating challenges and adapting to evolving business landscapes.</p>
                <p>I joined a small business after completed my MBA, overseeing operations, finance, HR, 
                    and marketing—from strategic planning to hands-on execution. Leveraging my prior experience 
                    in the automotive industry, I introduced efficiency-driven practices to this construction consultancy, 
                    optimizing project workflows and resource allocation.</p>
                <p>Recognizing that data is the backbone of operational excellence, I proactively enrolled in a 
                    Data Analysis Apprenticeship to sharpen my analytical skills. Since then, I’ve implemented data-driven strategies 
                    to identify bottlenecks, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making across the business.</p>
                <p>I then transitioned into a Business Intelligence Analyst role at a larger organization, 
                    where I collaborated with cross-functional stakeholders to track KPIs, identify operational inefficiencies, 
                    and implement data-backed improvements.</p>
                <p>I'm always looking to connect with inspiring people, learn about new projects,
                     and explore potential roles. Email me at: <a href="mailto:abc@efg.com">abc@efg.com</a> or call me at <a href="tel:1234567890">12-3456-7890</a></p>

                    <p>The company's reliance on shared testing equipment for client services is currently hampered by an informal 
                        and inefficient fault-reporting process. The existing method, which include a mixture of paper logs, spreadsheets, 
                        and verbal communication, lacks structure, accessibility, and accountability. This leads to critical issues including inconsistent Data, Lack of Visibility and Operational Friction.</p>
                    <p> This Equipment Issue Report and Management App is developed to streamlines the entire process of reporting, 
                        tracking and managing testing equipment faults. </p>
                    <p>The solution involves using the following tools:</p>

                            <li>Excel</li>
